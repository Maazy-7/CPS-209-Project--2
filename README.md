# 3D Renderer made in Java using Java Swing graphics
This project is a 3D renderer made in java using the Java Swing Framework

Features include:
- 3D and 4D Vector class used for vertex and object positions
- 4 by 4 Matrix class used for transformations
- Movable and lookable 3D camera
- Backface culling, normal calulations and surface lighting
- OBJ file reader to read vertex and face data in order to render imported (blender, Maya, etc) 3D models
- Painters algorithm and camera clipping

Controls:
- use WASD do move the camera
- use mouse to look around
- use shift to move up and left ctrl to move down
